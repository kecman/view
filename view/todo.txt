Present & Explain
-----------------

Provide the source code to follow along
Make a proper debug/release build for llvm
Practice explaining the compile loop
Mention that searching with <ident> :: is easy
Make a quick demo program with the syntax for basic things, but not trivial things:
  AxisBox and Polyline types
Demo with size of types, which store constants
Demo iterators on polylines, segment iterator, point iterator etc, stuff from boost geometry
Demo something with testing, maybe have a build target for that?
Demo tests using @test, make it work like the @PrintLike thing. You don't need to register them anywhere

If you've ever played his games, there are many ideas in them and they're all coupled and consistent. The game is kinda about exploring all the interactions


Questions
Is there a const concept?
