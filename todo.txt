Plan
[ ] 3D mesh shading and lights in the scene
[ ] Fix camera wierdness (Update orbit location when zooming to geometry, make sure frustrum contains everything)
[ ] Autogenerate code for bingings
[ ] Store model transforms matrix in mesh
[ ] Show points in the specific entity, not on the mesh, so this works better with polygons
[ ] Hash filename to colours
[ ] If file is hovered make it flash to white so it's easy to find

Backlog
[ ] Hot load the C++ bindings, and console commands, so you can keep same UI state while you iterate on your code
[ ] Don't pass pointers for arguments that aren't modified
[ ] Alternate segment colours (two draw calls?)
[ ] Compiled at time in Window, after version?
[ ] Implement sliding to show/hide the terminal
[ ] Scroll to the bottom of the terminal
[ ] Cleanup memory management for things returned by boost polygon module, should copy them on jai side and add a function to the bindings which free the mesh :Cleanup_Construction_Destruction:
[ ] Transparency with order as it is in the entity list
[ ] Cleanup construction/destruction: make functions to do that
[ ] Support polygons and polygon soups, and do convex decomposition for rendering
[ ] Support loading wkt file format
[ ] Cleanup text rendering, it's so slow right now!
[ ] Make the polygon/polyline types use slices, not dynamic arrays, put allocators in the top level
[ ] Autogenerate the console registering code to add commands to the console
[ ] Sort by time loaded
[ ] Distribution stuff, how to make this a single executable? statically link?
[ ] Write * to indicate an identical first and last point
[ ] Mode line showing the style info etc
[ ] Custom key-bindings and sensitivity of parameters, dynamically generate UI for this? and save to the text file
[ ] Understand and use context stuff (logging, assertions, allocators), watch https://youtu.be/ciGQCP6HgqI
[ ] Give each polyline a number 1-9 then pressing that number before some modifier for colour/vertex etc only modifies that one, number 0 means everything?
[ ] Toggle fullscreen/maximise
[ ] Some kind of ui cooldown for removing files? So that you don't loose track of what's being deleted
[ ] Zoom to origin
[ ] Show grid lines and label
[ ] Transparent imgui window so UI is like Fusion?
[ ] Distribute shaders with source for hot loading/editing them. Pass them lots of unused data then
[ ] Fix orbit/rotation location when many files are loaded but some aren't visible
[ ] Just log warnings and ignore the context allocator if it's not malloc, or create a new polygon allocated with malloc if passing to c
[ ] Extend the imgui_inspector example to allow you to drag+drop jai files and have show you all the types in the file
[ ] Use automatic differentiation in shape generation
[ ] Sounds for a more satifying UI?
[ ] Implement a view cube
[ ] Implement arcball constraints cf. http://graphicsinterface.org/wp-content/uploads/gi1992-18.pdf

Command list
[ ] save_obj <filename>, load_obj <filename> to load files (loading files by drag and drop should effectively run this command)
[ ] save_wkt <filename>, load_wkt <filename> to load files (loading files by drag and drop should effectively run this command)
[ ] save_session <filename>, load_session <session> to write all commands in the session
[ ] make_float/make_xform/make_mesh
[ ] xform <id> <transform>
[ ] edit <id> to popup inspection ui
[ ] assign x # assigns x to the previous result?
[ ] undo/redo

Boost Polygon bindings
[ ] Improve API, these accept pointers because the c++ functions take const-ref args
[ ] Can these declarations have notes? Check Preload.jai?
[ ] Write a function to print in wkt format? simpler custom format?

Build/test stuff
[ ] build_debug and build_release with proper llvm options
[ ] use @test to tag/run tests

Bugs
[ ] Fix memory leaks, need to use a new version of valgrind for --keep-debuginfo=yes option but it seems like getting to show line numbers properly isn't working
[ ] ImGui bindings for unix don't write declare CreateContext arguments #c_call

Script to build imgui as a library:

    # Build a static and dynamic library and copy to jai project.
    # Note: Using -fno-exceptions since without it linker called by Jai can't find _Unwind_Resume
    gcc -fno-exceptions -Wall -c *.cpp
    ar rcs ImGui.a *.o
    gcc -fno-exceptions -shared -fPIC -Wall -o ImGui.so  imgui.cpp imgui_draw.cpp imgui_demo.cpp 
    cp ImGui.a ImGui.so ~/Dropbox/jai/modules/ImGui/linux/.
