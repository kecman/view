[ ] Port the imgui 1.53 console to jai and use it to call the offset function
[ ] Autogenerate the console registering code to add commands to the console
[ ] Command list:
  - [ ] 3.14 # result is a float
  - [ ] wkt "s" # result is a shape described by "s"
  - [ ] assign x # assigns x to the previous result
  - [ ] offset x r # offsets x by r and creates a new result
  - [ ] load path/to/file.obj # load given file
  - [ ] run path/to/script.txt # run the commands in a given script
[ ] Rename project to polyline calculator?
[ ] Sort by time loaded
[ ] Distribution stuff, how to make this a single executable? statically link?
[ ] Support polygons and polygon soups, and do convex decomposition for rendering
[ ] Write * to indicate an identical first and last point
[ ] Mode line showing the style info etc
[ ] Load from command line?
[ ] Custom key-bindings and sensitivity of parameters, dynamically generate UI for this? and save to the text file

[ ] Understand and use context
  [ ] Watch the https://youtu.be/ciGQCP6HgqI video
  [ ] Understand and use logging
  [ ] Understand and use assertions
  [ ] Understand and use allocaters
[ ] Build system stuff: build_debug and build_release

[ ] Give each polyline a number 1-9 then pressing that number before some modifier for colour/vertex etc only modifies that one, number 0 means everything?
[ ] Optionally mesh the inside of the polyline
[ ] Alternate segment colours (two draw calls?)
[ ] Auto pick distinct colours
[ ] Toggle fullscreen/maximise
[ ] Some kind of ui cooldown for removing files? So that you don't loose track of what's being deleted
[ ] If file is hovered in the list then make it flash to white and back, and draw it lastt 
[ ] Make orbitting/rotatoin work based on the relation between the cursor position and the CoM of the visible shape? or orbit location

[ ] Dont distort geometry in non-square viewports
[ ] Zoom to origin
[ ] Show grid lines and label
[ ] Move polylines
[ ] Boost polygon bindings and a nice way to play around with the functions in a scripting way
[ ] Transparent imgui window so UI is like Fusion?
[ ] Compiled at time in Window, after version?
[ ] Distribute shaders with source for hot loading/editing them. Pass them lots of unused data then

[ ] Fix orbit/rotation location when many files are loaded but some aren't visible
[ ] Cleanup buffer_ids in openGL?

# bugs

[ ] Fix memory leaks, need to use a new version of valgrind for --keep-debuginfo=yes option but it seems like getting to show line numbers properly isn't working

# boost polygon bindings

[ ] Look at how Hash_Table is implemented by storing an `entries : []Entry;` array, not a dynamic array [..], and then having the allocator stuff separate, I should do the same for Polygon types

Present & Explain
-----------------

Provide the source code to follow along
Make a proper debug/release build for llvm
Practice explaining the compile loop
Mention that searching with <ident> :: is easy
Make a quick demo program with the syntax for basic things, but not trivial things:
  AxisBox and Polyline types
Demo with size of types, which store constants
Demo iterators on polylines, segment iterator, point iterator etc, stuff from boost geometry
Demo something with testing, maybe have a build target for that?
Demo tests using @test, make it work like the @PrintLike thing. You don't need to register them anywhere

Make sure you can explain the context stuff, including logging and allocation

If you've ever played his games, there are many ideas in them and they're all coupled and consistent. The game is kinda about exploring all the interactions

do not read the JaiPrimer

Having a single code declaration and simple syntax makes it so easy to grep your code, so you don't need a frikkin IDE to be able to jump to definition. And your computer runs much faster.

Error messages and compile times alone are the best!

Joy of programming: prevents burnout

Questions
Is there a const concept?
Can you debug at compile time ie while running bytecode?



Put this on github, and then make a github io page

Very different philosophy RE how to program, everything very simple. Makes *some* things inconvenient, but no the hard things e.g.,
- initialising things is a bit annoying, you need to declare+init right now. 
- operator overloading limited, so longer function names, and simple imports/namespaces (no adl) mean sometimes annoying to use




## Misc ideas

- Extend the imgui_inspector example to allow you to drag+drop jai files and have show you all the types in the file
- @Bug ImGui bindings for unix don't write declare CreateContext arguments #c_call
