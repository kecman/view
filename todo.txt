Plan

Fix bug with polyline offsetting (problem with clockwise_boundaries? perhaps should be using boundaries instead)
from output of print_Polygon_Soup (looks correct) and print_Polyline_Soup (looks broken) I think the bug is in clockwise_boundaries returning a bad result

[ ] Implement a debug macro/Code thing which prints the variable name followed by it's value
[ ] Implement recursive print_recursive function to recurse into arrays/structs etc
[ ] Cleanup construction/destruction: make functions to do that
[ ] Support polygons and polygon soups, and do convex decomposition for rendering
[ ] Support loading wkt file format
[ ] Support 3D mesh rendering
[ ] Cleanup text rendering, it's so slow right now!
[-] :OnlyRenderMeshType: Refactor to only render the Mesh type
[ ] Hash filename to colours
[ ] Make the polygon/polyline types use slices, not dynamic arrays, put allocators in the top level
[ ] Autogenerate the console registering code to add commands to the console
[ ] Rename project to polyline calculator?
[ ] Sort by time loaded
[ ] Distribution stuff, how to make this a single executable? statically link?
[ ] Write * to indicate an identical first and last point
[ ] Mode line showing the style info etc
[ ] Custom key-bindings and sensitivity of parameters, dynamically generate UI for this? and save to the text file
[ ] Understand and use context stuff (logging, assertions, allocators), watch https://youtu.be/ciGQCP6HgqI
[ ] Give each polyline a number 1-9 then pressing that number before some modifier for colour/vertex etc only modifies that one, number 0 means everything?
[ ] Alternate segment colours (two draw calls?)
[ ] Auto pick distinct colours
[ ] Toggle fullscreen/maximise
[ ] Some kind of ui cooldown for removing files? So that you don't loose track of what's being deleted
[ ] If file is hovered in the list then make it flash to white and back, and draw it lastt 
[ ] Make orbitting/rotatoin work based on the relation between the cursor position and the CoM of the visible shape? or orbit location
[ ] Dont distort geometry in non-square viewports
[ ] Zoom to origin
[ ] Show grid lines and label
[ ] Transform entities
[ ] Boost polygon bindings and a nice way to play around with the functions in a scripting way
[ ] Transparent imgui window so UI is like Fusion?
[ ] Compiled at time in Window, after version?
[ ] Distribute shaders with source for hot loading/editing them. Pass them lots of unused data then
[ ] Fix orbit/rotation location when many files are loaded but some aren't visible
[ ] Cleanup buffer_ids in openGL?
[ ] Look at Hash_Table. It stores an array slice (`entries : []Entry;`), not a dynamic array [..], and has a separate allocator, should do the same for Polygon types
[ ] Just log warnings and ignore the context allocator if it's not malloc, or create a new polygon allocated with malloc if passing to c
[ ] Extend the imgui_inspector example to allow you to drag+drop jai files and have show you all the types in the file

Command list
[ ] save_obj <filename>, load_obj <filename> to load files (loading files by drag and drop should effectively run this command)
[ ] save_wkt <filename>, load_wkt <filename> to load files (loading files by drag and drop should effectively run this command)
[ ] save_session <filename>, load_session <session> to write all commands in the session
[ ] make_float/make_xform/make_mesh
[ ] xform <id> <transform>
[ ] edit <id> to popup inspection ui
[ ] assign x # assigns x to the previous result?
[ ] undo/redo

Boost Polygon bindings
[ ] Improve API, these accept pointers because the c++ functions take const-ref args
[ ] Can these declarations have notes? Check Preload.jai?
[ ] Write a function to print in wkt format? simpler custom format?

Build/test stuff
[ ] build_debug and build_release with proper llvm options
[ ] use @test to tag/run tests

Bugs
[ ] Fix memory leaks, need to use a new version of valgrind for --keep-debuginfo=yes option but it seems like getting to show line numbers properly isn't working
[ ] ImGui bindings for unix don't write declare CreateContext arguments #c_call
