The name `garage` comes from [The Airtight Garage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtight_Garage). In the opening pages engineer Barnier gets very upset because his beautiful Cablebox explodes, I love the colours in these pages and I hope to make `garage` a similarly colourful debugging experience!
