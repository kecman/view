- [Cleanup] memory management for things returned by boost polygon module, should copy them on jai side and add a function to the bindings which free the mesh :Cleanup_Construction_Destruction:

- [Rendering] Show grid lines
- [UI/UX] Sounds for a more satifying UI?
- [Commands] Implement geometric equals functions for testing, can be used to compare Jai/C++ implementations

- [XXL] Hotload jai code so that you can keep state while you change your algorithm
- [Robustness] Just log warnings and ignore the context allocator if it's not malloc, or create a new polygon allocated with malloc if passing to c

- [XXL,UI/UX] Think about how to do literate programming in Jai, use this to generate the user documentation. Maybe with notes attached to procedures or decalarations? It would be cool to generate context specific help windows using this information in comments/notes somehow, maybe a local variable matching some pattern get processed by a meta program?
