## v0.0.4

- [UI/UX,Camera] First person camera with strafing and jump/crouch
- [Refactor] Move data from Mesh type into Entity type. This unblocks:
    - [UI/UX] Cache mesh bounding box so that fit to screen is faster when working with large meshes
    - [UI/UX] Mode line (bar along bottom) showing hovered mesh stats
    - [UI/UX] Show the bounding box in the mesh stats view
    - [Rendering] Transparency
    - [Rendering] Surface with edges
- [Commands] save_obj <filename> <optional-element-index-list>
- [UI/UX] Display file load time
- [UI/UX] F5 to refresh file
- [Robustness] add tests for obj loading

## Backlog

- [UI/UX] Hotload the keymap and settings files
- [UI/UX] Option to render the cumulative vertex number for polyline soups and polygon inner/outer rings or polygon soups
- [UI/UX] Scale zoom speed with scene bounding box when shift is held?
- [UI/UX] Implement a view cube using the Simp module
- [Performance] Speed up text rendering, it's so slow right now!
- [UI/UX] Scale the axes according to the bbox of the scene?
- [UI/UX] Arrow keys pan across bounding box?
- [UI/UX] Make items filenames selectable so they can be all selected and then refreshed
- [Presentation] Explain high-level goals
- [Refactor] Remove geometry module, just load files
- [Meta-programming,Testing] Use @test to tag/run tests
- [Meta-programming,Commands] Autogenerate code for bingings
- [Meta-programming,Commands] Autogenerate ui code for bingings
- [UI/UX] Implement arcball constraints cf. http://graphicsinterface.org/wp-content/uploads/gi1992-18.pdf
- [XXL,UI/UX,Camera] Undo/redo system for camera and other operations
- [UI/UX,Camera] Camera position history/bookmarks with notes/annotations
- [Rendering] Render vertex labels on top of other geometry always
- [UI/UX] Write * to indicate an identical first and last point
- [UI/UX] Sweep drag for removing items from the scene?
- [UI/UX] Click to copy point coordinate in {1.8e} format so that it can be used as a float literal in code
- [UI/UX] Support loading wkt file format to load Polygons in a reasonable way
- [UI/UX] Implement sliding to show/hide the terminal
- [UI/UX] Scroll to the bottom of the terminal
- [Build,DevX] Compiled at time in Window, after version?
- [Cleanup] memory management for things returned by boost polygon module, should copy them on jai side and add a function to the bindings which free the mesh :Cleanup_Construction_Destruction:
- [Cleanup] Make the polygon/polyline types use slices, not dynamic arrays, put allocators in the top level
- [Meta-programming] Autogenerate the console registering code to add commands to the console
- [Meta-programming] Generate a list of used ImGui functions, to simplify transitioning to a newer version
- [Rendering] Alternate segment colours (two draw calls?)
- [Rendering] Show grid lines
- [UI/UX] Sounds for a more satifying UI?
- [Commands] Implement geometric equals functions for testing, can be used to compare Jai/C++ implementations
- [Commands] load_obj <filename> to load files (loading files by drag and drop should effectively run this command)
- [Commands] Implement commands to change the render settings on stuff
- [Commands] save_wkt <filename>, load_wkt <filename> to load files (loading files by drag and drop should effectively run this command)
- [Commands] save_session <filename>, load_session <session> to write all commands in the session
- [Commands] make_float/make_xform/make_mesh
- [Commands] xform <id> <transform>
- [Commands] edit <id> to popup inspection ui
- [Commands] assign x # assigns x to the previous result?
- [Commands] undo/redo
- [Bindings] Improve API, these accept pointers because the c++ functions take const-ref args
- [Bindings] Can these declarations have notes? Check Preload.jai?
- [Bindings] Write a function to print in wkt format? simpler custom format?
- [Bindings] Add libIGL bindings?
- [UI/UX] Render the axes origin in different color when it's a model origin
- [UI/UX,Bug] Include axes in fit_on_screen, and fix positioning of near and far planes
- [Bug] ImGui bindings for unix don't write declare CreateContext arguments #c_call
- [Bug] Fix normal transformation in shapes.jai and port the fix to par_shapes
- [Build] Bake fonts into the executable
- [XXL] Build and add bindings for gmp
- [XXL] Hotload the C++ bindings, and console commands, so you can keep same UI state while you iterate on your code
- [XXL] Hotload jai code so that you can keep state while you change your algorithm
- [Robustness] Just log warnings and ignore the context allocator if it's not malloc, or create a new polygon allocated with malloc if passing to c
- [Rendering] Distribute shaders with source for hot loading/editing them. Pass them lots of unused data then
