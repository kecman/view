- [UI/UX] Support loading wkt file format to load Polygons in a reasonable way
- [UI/UX] Implement wild cards for file loading
- [UI/UX] Implement an infinite grid, maybe http://asliceofrendering.com/scene%20helper/2020/01/05/InfiniteGrid/

- [XXL] Think about a plugin system where you write bindings for c++ libraries and benefit from Jai introspection e.g., bind to C++ datastructures/algorithms, and auto generate UI for Jai versions of those for fast experimentation/UI generation
